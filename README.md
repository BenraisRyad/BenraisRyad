## Hi there nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Ryad Benrais. Iâ€™m an IT development technician undergoing a transformation â€“ kind of like a constantly updating code (but with fewer bugs, I promise! ðŸ˜‰).

Already a graduate in development and passionate about infrastructure, networking, and systems, I bring the best of both worlds as a coder and machine whisperer. My dream? To become an IT engineer and master the technologies that are shaping the future (or at least finally conquer the mystery of making the office printer work every time!).

Currently, Iâ€™m fully immersed in my engineering studies and on the lookout for a work-study opportunity. If you enjoy ambitious projects and nerdy conversations, let's connect!
